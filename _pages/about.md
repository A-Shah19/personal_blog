**Background 
I graduated with my Bachelor's in Computer Science from Cornell University in 2019 and have been a software engineer in the San Francisco Bay Area since then. Check out my main website **[here](https://a-shah19.github.io/).

**Interests
I am a software engineer, landscape photographer, and self proclaimed cooking fanatic. My professional interests are in backend engineering for scalable cloud based systems, computer vision applications in medical imaging, and understanding culinary preferences with natural language processing.
