## Background

Being unhealthy, eating junk food, and consuming massive portions are easy because we succumb to our urges. So, why not have a personalized tool that makes staying on track easy for dietary goals, meal planning, and pantry tracking? Meals made easy helps ease the transition to a cleaner and healthier lifestyle with the three main focuses:
- [**Pantry**](#pantry)

## Pantry

The Pantry allows you to keep track of what groceries and supplies you have on hand. Each item is added with a suggested expiration or "use-by" date so you know before the fridge starts smelling rotten. The pantry also allows you to consume ingredients as you go and update how many you have left as you make each recipe. 

## Recipe Book

The Recipe book is a digital record of your favorite dishes and creations. Whether it be scrambled eggs for breakfast or a 5 course meal, you can log any necessary ingredients and the steps you followed to create your meal. Ingredients can be pulled in from the Pantry or entered manually for ease of use. Additionally, you can log nutritional information like calories, protein, fat content, etc. to have a better understanding of what you're consuming.

## Meal Planner

The Meal Planner allows you to schedule meals over the course of the week by pulling in recipes from your Recipe book or independently adding them. The Meal planner also sums up your nutritional intake over the course of the day and gives you a daily summary of what you're putting into your body to see if you're hitting your dietary goals.
